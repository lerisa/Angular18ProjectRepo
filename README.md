# Angular18ProjectRepo

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Build and watch

If you want to build the app, and rebuild on any changes, but for whatever reason don't want to run `ng serve`, you can also run `npm run build:watch`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
You can also run `npm run test:watch` to run the unit test suite, and then watch for changes.
